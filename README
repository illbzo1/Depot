Working through Agile Web Development with Rails. I doubt I'll edit this shopping cart application much beyond what the book suggests, but it's a good idea to use Git for source control.
---
I changed the CSS slightly, to include a 1px border around the product images. 
---
Validation! - Added some tests. Had to make sure I got my yml right.
---
Layout update - This update includes both layout changes and more work with functional tests. I've added a display for the current date and time in the sidebar, formatted using an initializer.
---
Cart update - I've added basic cart functionality. Extra stuff includes displaying Time.now in the application view as well as a counter that tracks how often a user has visited the site.
---
More work on the cart - The cart works better now. Users can add multiple items to the cart and the price automatically updates. I've also added line item deletion from the cart view, as well as a redirect to the cart view upon deleting a line item and a redirect to the store itself upon removing the last item in a cart.
---
Adding some ajax - A lot of styling in this update. The cart in the sidebar now updates with Ajax calls. Users can also delete items from the cart and it automatically refreshes. I may update this functionality so users can add or remove items once a line item has been created. We'll see!
---
Working on checkout - Users can now check out. I've also hidden the check out button when a user is already in the checkout phase.
